# DepthEye: Real-Time Stereo Vision Depth Estimation  

**DepthEye** is a real-time depth estimation system built using stereo vision principles, designed to calculate the distance of objects from a stereo camera setup. The project leverages Python, OpenCV, and triangulation techniques to achieve precise depth measurement, making it ideal for applications in robotics, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and 3D mapping.  

### Features  
- **Stereo Vision-Based Depth Estimation**: Utilizes two cameras to compute object distance through disparity and triangulation.  
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Implements HSV filtering and contour analysis to detect and track circular objects.  
- **Efficient Image Processing**: Applies Gaussian blurring, color space transformations, and shape recognition for robust performance.  
- **Accurate Depth Calculation**: Incorporates calibrated camera parameters, baseline distance, and focal length for precise measurement.  

### Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Imutils, Matplotlib  
- **Hardware**: Stereo camera setup  
- **Algorithms**: HSV filtering, contour detection, disparity calculation, and triangulation  

### Applications  
- Robotics: Enables obstacle detection and navigation.  
- AR/VR: Enhances spatial awareness for immersive experiences.  
- 3D Mapping: Provides depth information for object reconstruction.  

### Challenges Addressed  
- Camera calibration for accurate depth measurement.  
- Real-time processing with high frame rates (up to 120 fps).  
- Handling noise and lighting variations in dynamic environments.  

This project demonstrates the power of stereo vision in real-time scenarios and serves as a foundation for more advanced computer vision applications.
